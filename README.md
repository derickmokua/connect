# 🐔 KukuConnect: The High-Yield Poultry System

> **"We don't just sell chicks; we deploy a Success System to your farm."**

**KukuConnect** is a specialized e-commerce and farm management platform designed for the modern African poultry farmer. It simplifies the complex process of starting a standardized Improved Kienyeji (Kuroiler) flock by focusing on **Logistics, Bio-Security, and Profitability**.

## 🚀 The Mission

Most small-scale farmers fail because of the "Danger Zone" (the first 21 days). KukuConnect solves this by:
1.  **Selling Hardened 4-Week-Old Birds**: We take the risk of brooding so the farmer doesn't have to.
2.  **Digitizing the Care Routine**: A built-in "Success Timeline" guides the farmer on exactly what to feed and vaccinate.
3.  **WhatsApp First**: We recognize that real business in Kenya happens on WhatsApp. The entire checkout flow is designed to build a cart and finalize the details via a direct WhatsApp chat.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛒 The "Start Your Batch" Engine
A step-by-step wizard that treats poultry farming like a business plan.
- **Stage Selector**: Choose between Day-Olds (Cheap) vs. 4-Week-Olds (Safe).
- **Profit Calculator**: Real-time estimates of total investment.
- **Success Kits**: One-click add-ons for Vaccines and Feed.

### 🤖 Kuku Assistant (AI Chatbot)
An intelligent, context-aware assistant trained on veterinary best practices.
- **Farmer-First Language**: It speaks simply and directly.
- **Guardrails**: It knows when to advise a vet visit vs. simple home remedies.
- It helps new farmers troubleshoot simple issues like "Why are my chicks huddling?"

### 📅 The Immunity Protocol
A visual vaccination schedule that demystifies bio-security. It shows exactly what vaccines (Gumboro, Newcastle) have been administered before the birds arrive.
